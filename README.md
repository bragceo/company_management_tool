## Overview of Code structure and its components:

index.js: This file is the entry point for the application. It imports the asciiart-logo module and a function called promptUser from ./utils/ui. It then calls the init function, which displays the logo using console.log and prompts the user for input by calling promptUser.

utils/ui.js: This file exports a function called promptUser, which uses the inquirer module to prompt the user for input. Based on the user's input, it calls functions from the db/view.js, db/add.js, db/update.js, or db/remove.js modules to perform database operations.

db/add.js: This file exports functions that add data to the database. There are three functions in this file:

newDepartment(): Prompts the user for a new department name and inserts it into the department table.

newRole(): Prompts the user for a new role title, salary, and department, and inserts it into the role table.

newEmployee(): Prompts the user for a new employee's first name, last name, role, and manager, and inserts it into the employee table.

db/remove.js: This file exports functions that remove data from the database. There are three functions in this file:

deleteDepartment(): Prompts the user to select a department to delete and removes it from the department table.

deleteRole(): Prompts the user to select a role to delete and removes it from the role table.

deleteEmployee(): Prompts the user to select an employee to delete and removes it from the employee table.

Each of the files uses the mysql2 module to interact with the database. The console.table module is used to display the results of queries to the console in a formatted table. The inquirer module is used to prompt the user for input and handle their responses. The functions in db/view.js, db/update.js, db/remove.js, and db/add.js are exported so that they can be used by utils/ui.js. Finally, utils/ui.js exports the promptUser function so that it can be called by index.js
 

## How to run the application
 
You can run the application by running this command in the application directory
node index.js
